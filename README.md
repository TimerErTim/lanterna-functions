# Lanterna-Functions
This is a feature extending library for Lanterna, a 100% pure Java terminal-like text based GUI.
## Introduction
Aim of this project is to provide a library with extra functions for the [Lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) library. This repository was created to provide features needed in the [Text-Fighter](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/graphs/contributors) project to provide a console-like GUI. It may be updated in the future to provide extra functionality.
## Dependencies
In order to use this library you will obviously have to add [Lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) to your library. This can be done with Maven as shown on the projects [README](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna/blob/master/README.md) or Gradle using the same dependency information as you would with Maven. Alternatively you can download the .jar files [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/googlecode/lanterna/lanterna/3.0.3/lanterna-3.0.3.jar) and add it to your project as library like you would with Ant.
### Version
**The version of Lanterna used is _[3.0.3](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.googlecode.lanterna/lanterna/3.0.3)_, so take this into account when using Gradle or Maven. Compatibility is not guaranted with other versions (however it is still very much possible).**
