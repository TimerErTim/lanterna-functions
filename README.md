# Lanterna-Functions
This is a feature extending library for Lanterna, a 100% pure Java terminal-like text based GUI.
## Introduction
Aim of this project is to provide a library with extra functions for the [Lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) library. This repository was created to provide features needed in the [Text-Fighter](https://github.com/hhaslam11/Text-Fighter/graphs/contributors) project to provide a console-like GUI. It may be updated in the future to provide extra functionality.
